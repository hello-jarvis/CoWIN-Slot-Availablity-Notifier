# CoWIN-Slot-Availablity-Notifier
This repository contains all the code files required to install the "CoWIN Slot Availablity Notifier" chrome extension. This extension can also be installed via Chrome Web Store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cowin-slot-availablity-no/cijfoobajnpgpphocpkdcplfphadeaea).

I had created this chrome extension in May 2021 in order to facilitate non-programmers in booking slots for their vaccination appointments since vaccination slots vanished within seconds at that time due to high demand. This was also my first experiment with Google Chrome Extension Development. Around that time, this extension reached ~3.5k active users.

As of October 2021, this extension still works well in pulling data from CoWIN APIs and notifying the user of available vaccination slots.
